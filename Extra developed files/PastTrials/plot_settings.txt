# When just considering a plot, i.e. no errors, just one plot in the figure
# Axis title/labels
font=Times New Roman
size=26
note=put units in parenthesis, i.e. Z (nm) and in fugure caption explain what is Z

# Axis numbers
font=Times New Roman
size=24
note=Consider 4-6 ticks, preferably 5 ticks

# Extra notes:
# Legend - Off for images, but useful if can get two plots (one with and one without to know what is going on on both and have the freedom to use the one without without mixing up the data points)
# Consider using different colors and shapes, so that people with B/W printers can also properly see the data
# Consider the figure to be closed, i.e. all borders surrounding the plot show the ticks, but just labels on left and bottom sides

# For axis labels can also use a small description of the variables if space, i.e. Wavelength, Î» (nm)

# When considering two plots in a figure, i.e. plot and the residuals
# Same, for main plot
# For residual plot,
# Same about size and font. Much smaller height (at least half of the main plot) and dotted horizontal lines to facilitate analysis.
